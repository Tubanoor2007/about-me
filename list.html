                Skincare is the set of activities that can be carried out daily for
                the improvement and maintenance of the skin at an aesthetic level. It is a set of
                actions that have been brought to the fore with great success by major brands and
                influencers. The reason for the explosion, in a positive sense, of this phenomenon
                is to be found in the need to take a moment all to yourself during the day. Frantic
                lifestyles and stressful commitments have now become the order of the day. Despite
                this, however, it is important to remember every day to take a few moments to take care of yourself.
                Skincare is therefore not only the application of different products to the skin, but over time it has
                also acquired a deeper meaning that goes beyond the superficiality attached to the term.

                Gentle cleansing: in the morning, to prepare our skin to face the day, it is necessary 
                to cleanse it delicately. In fact, during the night, despite the skincare done the previous evening, various types of dust and dirt will have accumulated. For this reason it is important to proceed with a cleaning, even if delicate, made with not very aggressive products.
Hydration: after cleaning the skin, it's time to hydrate it with a LIGHT cream that absorbs quickly,
 allowing us to proceed with the makeup if necessary, without having to wait a long time. At the same time, however, in this way, we will guarantee an optimal level of hydration throughout the day.
      3. Protection: if we are preparing to spend hours away from home, and especially outdoors,
       it is important to apply a product that protects against smog and UVA - UVB rays. Many bb creams and foundations on the market today, in addition to coverage and improvement of the complexion, also guarantee this type of protection.
